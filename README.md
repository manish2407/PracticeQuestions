In this repository, we implement and write all code of possible practice questions based on java programming language from beginner level to advanced level.

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies. It is a general-purpose programming language that provide programmers/application developers to write once, run anywhere (WORA), It means that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems Java platform.

Java follows Object-Oriented paradigm of programming. OOP concept has four main pillers that are as follows-

1-Abstraction

2-Encapsulation

3-Polymorphism 

4- Inheritance

It mainly focus on class and object also it has some focus terms like methods, vaiables, fields etc.
